## Sequence 9: Seer

![Klein Seer Art](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lord-of-the-mystery/images/3/3f/Klein_Seer_Art.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20240302232223)
### New Abilities

- **Divination**:[?](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Divination_Art "Divination Art") They lack direct skills confronting enemies but are experts in **Divination**. They are able to master all kinds of **Divination** methods, including astrology, cartomancy, spiritual pendulums, spiritual numbers, and scrying. (Ch. 29)

- **Danger Intuition**: They can intuitively detect danger using their **Spirituality**.

- **Spirit Vision**:[?](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Vision "Spirit Vision") They can use **Spirit Vision** to see non-physical things, such as ghosts and specters. They could see the different parts of a [Soul](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Soul "Soul"), deduce a person's health and emotions, and determine if something has a magical aura. (Ch 32)

- **Mysticism**: In terms of knowledge of [Mysticism](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Mysticism), a **Seer** will be more learned and professional than a [Mystery Pryer](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Hermit_Pathway/Abilities#Sequence_9:_Mystery_Pryer). (Ch. 29)
    - They don't directly gain knowledge about **Mysticism**, only the skills and abilities to learn it.

- **Enhanced Memory**: Initially, **Seers** have a slight increase in memory that improves along with the digestion of the potion.

- They can “see” obstructed objects and “hear” faint footsteps, allowing them to take preemptive judgment. But their visual, auditory, and tactile senses do not have any enhancements. (Ch. 44)
## Sequence 8: Clown

**Clowns** are good at fighting with artifice and are very crafty.

![Klein Clown Art](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lord-of-the-mystery/images/b/b4/Klein_Clown_Art.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20240302232302)
### New Abilities (Ch. 169)

- **Physical Enhancements**: After advancement **Clown** receives a powerful body, making them akin to a master acrobat.
    - A **Clown** has near complete control over their bodily functions.
        - Their limbs will not move if they don't will them to.
        - Their face will only show the expressions they wish to show, with the only situations such as extreme shock or pain causing them to show their true feelings.
            - This makes them the nemesis of [Spectators](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Visionary_Pathway/Abilities#Sequence_9:_Spectator), as they cannot accurately read a **Clown**'s body language
    - They gain powerful coordination and a near inhumane sense of balance. A **Clown** will never lose their balance, barring any extreme circumstances. The increased coordination also makes them very talented at learning combat skills.
        - This allows them to walk over tightropes as if they were flat ground, or jump and land on the backrest of a chair without stumbling.
        - After becoming a **Clown**, [Klein](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Klein_Moretti "Klein Moretti") went from the level a newbie fighter, to the level of an apprentice knight who had been training for months over the span of a single session of combat training. He also became a lot better at shooting.
    - Their agility and speed becomes exceptional, while their strength gains a decent increase.
        - These enhancements allow a **Clown** to commit various feats of acrobatics, such as swinging themselves up by their feet, easily scaling the outsides of buildings or using backflips to evade attacks during fights.
        - Thanks to the increased strength, [Klein](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Klein_Moretti "Klein Moretti") was capable of knocking out two burly and experienced bouncers in just three strikes.
- **Paper Daggers**: A **Clown** becomes capable of temporarily turning sheets of paper as hard and sharp as steel, allowing them to throw them as flying daggers or use them as knives.
    - [Klein](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Klein_Moretti "Klein Moretti") killed [Meursault](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Meursault "Meursault") by piercing his throat with an unfinished draft of a contract.

#### Strengthened Abilities
- **Danger Intuition**: The Spiritual Intuition of a **Clown** is greatly enhanced, even granting them an unreliable short term form of premonition.
    - A **Clown** can supernaturally see the appearance of someone standing behind a door without ever opening it.
    - A **Clown** can sometimes intuitively predict the next action somebody will take. This is very useful during combat, but cannot be relied upon as it happens sporadically and infrequently. It can only provide an opportunity to take advantage of.
        - Like **Divination**, this ability is much more reliable when it comes to actions that will cause harm to the **Clown**. This allows them to often pre-dodge attacks that would be very damaging or even lethal.
## Sequence 7: Magician

![Klein Magician Art](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lord-of-the-mystery/images/9/99/Klein_Magician_Art.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20240302232332)

### New Abilities (Ch. 296)

- **Magicians** gain _9 spells_ that can be cast at high speeds, without needing to chant or inject **Spirituality**.
    
    1. **Damage Transfer**: As long as a **Magician** is not dead and can still move their hand, they can transfer vital wound to an unimportant areas like arms, turning fatal wounds into minor injuries, however they can't transfer the damage to other people or items.
        - Each wound can only be transferred once.
        - They can also transfer the wounds of others. (Ch. 416)
    2. **Flaming Jump**: A **Magician** can phase through a fire spark that they had left behind and any flame that existed within 30 meters. This range would increase over time as the **Magician** digests the potion.
        - It's similar to **Teleportation**, except it doesn't require help from the [Spirit World](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_World "Spirit World").
            - This allowed [Klein](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Klein_Moretti "Klein Moretti") to use **Flaming Jump** inside the [Foggy Town](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Hornacis_Mountain_Range#Foggy_Town "Hornacis Mountain Range") even though **Teleportation** from [Creeping Hunger](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Creeping_Hunger "Creeping Hunger") was restricted. (Ch. 835)
        - They are immune to ordinary flames at the moment they uses this power.
            - This allowed [Klein](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Klein_Moretti "Klein Moretti") to jump on the flames above a meteor. However, upon exiting that state, he had to do his best to avoid the flames via **Flame Controlling**. Otherwise, he would have suffered burn wounds and even burned to death. (Ch. 472)
    3. **Air Bullet**: They can produce air projectiles with power and speed comparable to that of bullets fired from a custom revolver just by snapping their fingers or mimicking sounds. Furthermore, the effect would improve along with the digestion of the potion and the raising of their Sequence.
    4. **Paper Figurine Substitute**: They can transform a **Paper Figurine** into themselves and swap places with the figurine. It can not only block a fatal blow, but also weaken the damage from **Hexes**.
        - After using the substitution spell, the **Magician** would reappear in a different but nearby location.
        - They can also use these substitutes as crude body doubles to fool others into thinking they were there. (Ch. 300)
    5. **Flame Controlling**: A **Magician** can manipulate flames and ignite certain items within a range of _30 meters_ with a simple action. The range increases with digestion. Once the potion has been completely digested, they could summon a swirling flame out of thin air.
    6. **Illusion Creation**: By influencing the surrounding environment, a **Magician** can create **Illusions** with colors, sounds, and smells that would be close to reality, allowing them to pass off the false as true and deceive the enemy.
    7. **Underwater Breathing**: A **Magician** gains the ability to breathe underwater. The principle behind it was to create a thin, invisible air pipe which would allow the **Magician** to breathe freely and seemingly turn into a [Murloc](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Creatures_and_Plants#Murloc "Creatures and Plants"). The initial length of the invisible air pipe is _5 meters_. As the potion digests, the length of the pipe would increase.
    8. **Bone Softening**: A **Magician** can soften their bones to some degree to escape from handcuffs, ropes, and chests.
    9. **Drawing Paper As Weapons**: The evolution of the **Clown's** ability to turn paper into throwing knives. This ability allows a **Magician** to turn paper into sharp objects, but it could also temporarily turn into weapons such as bats or bricks, etc.
    
    - In addition, **Magicians** will attain some tiny tricks, but they aren't very practical.

#### Strengthened Abilities
- **Magicians** experience a qualitative change
    - Their hands become more agile and their body become more nimble.
    - Their **Spirit Vision** is slightly enhanced, but not by much. They cannot see the **Astral Projection** surface deep in the **Ether Body** and, as such, are unable to judge whether a target is a Beyonder or not.[[10]](https://lordofthemysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Fool_Pathway/Abilities#cite_note-10)
- They have many tricks to interfere with spiritual intuition of a target.
