- - - 
found barrels of food and stuff, one of them is ale
- [Meluk](Meluk%20McDod.md) starts drinking a cuppa, [Gehrman](Gehrman%20Sparrow.md) nudges [Far](Far%20Alskare.md) and points at [Meluk](Meluk%20McDod.md)
	- [Far](Far%20Alskare.md) proceeds to cast prestidigitation to make the liquid, look, smell, and taste like ejaculate (cum) 

guy brings us to room, another guy came in and was suspicious, still brought us to [Glasstaff](../../03%20-%20Resources/Glasstaff.md) 

we try to attack, but [Glasstaff](../../03%20-%20Resources/Glasstaff.md) closes the door behind him

open the door, nothing’s there, [Meluk](Meluk%20McDod.md) and [Far](Far%20Alskare.md) think [Glasstaff](../../03%20-%20Resources/Glasstaff.md) is invisible, [Far](Far%20Alskare.md) proceeds to fireball an empty fucking room, [Glasstaff](../../03%20-%20Resources/Glasstaff.md)’s room, which should contain cool shit, all burnt, gone, forever. [Far](Far%20Alskare.md) finds a secret door in the room, [Glasstaff](../../03%20-%20Resources/Glasstaff.md) used that door to escape. 

random guy who brought us here blocks [Meluk](Meluk%20McDod.md) and [Gehrman](Gehrman%20Sparrow.md) from going into the fireballed room where [Far](Far%20Alskare.md) is. 

[Gehrman](Gehrman%20Sparrow.md) kills the guy with a crit, dashes into the room, and dashes into the door, finds another secret door. 

[Meluk](Meluk%20McDod.md) follows and goes on ahead, catching up to [Glasstaff](../../03%20-%20Resources/Glasstaff.md), who is in shock as to how a 4ft ish dwarf guy in heavy armor, with a shield, AND a war hammer in hand caught up to him.

[Gehrman](Gehrman%20Sparrow.md) interrogated a guy, he said: 
- bugbears taking dwarf off to a castle (cragmore castle)

[Meluk](Meluk%20McDod.md) killed one, got hit, WITH ONE HP REMAINING. [Meluk](Meluk%20McDod.md) SLAMMED HIS SHIELD DOWN AND STOOD LIKE A BADASS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH. [Far](Far%20Alskare.md) MISSES ANOTHER FUCKING SPELL. [Gehrman](Gehrman%20Sparrow.md) KILLS THE REMAINING ENEMY IN THE NICK OF TIME.
