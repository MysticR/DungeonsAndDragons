mid-fight
- identified giant monster as ogre
- [Gehrman Sparrow](Gehrman%20Sparrow.md) and [Meluk](Meluk%20McDod.md) 
	- [Gehrman Sparrow](Gehrman%20Sparrow.md) rolled 2 20s crit and did a lot of fucking damage (fuck all of you)

> [!summary] Summary of fight outside cave 
> - bitch boy ([Far Alskare](Far%20Alskare.md)) extremely close to death (2/3 failed rolls, one more would’ve been a goner, saved him just in time)
> - [Gehrman Sparrow](Gehrman%20Sparrow.md) almost died, had 4 hp, but locked in and clutched tf up
> - [Meluk](Meluk%20McDod.md) good ol’ reliable tanked hits

coming back to [Phandalin](Phandalin.md), [Redbrands](Redbrands.md) fucked up mommy’s (Linene, master of Lionshield Coster here) shop 
- we’re all pissed because she saved our asses in a previous battle with [Redbrands](Redbrands.md) ruffians

go to [Redbrands](Redbrands.md) hideout
weird creature thing reads our minds or something
- big eye mystical thing
	- [Nothic](Nothic.md)
- we’re at hideout, just found secret hidden storeroom behind wall thing and door thing (have to clarify)
